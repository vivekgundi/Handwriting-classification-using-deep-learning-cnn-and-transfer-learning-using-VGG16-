## Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for handwriting classification. The goal is to correctly identify the writer of a given handwritten text image. The model is trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics.

## Dataset

- The dataset consists of images of handwritten text samples from multiple writers.
- Each image is labeled with the writer's name.
- The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.
- Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve generalization.

## Model Architecture

The model follows a CNN-based approach, consisting of:

- Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max-pooling layers for feature extraction
- Fully connected dense layers for classification
- Softmax activation for multi-class classification

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwriting-classification.git
cd handwriting-classification


```

## Usage

Run the notebook to train and test the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook best_final_model.ipynb
```

To predict a new handwritten sample:

```python
from model import predict_writer

image_path = "path/to/handwritten_sample.jpg"
predicted_writer = predict_writer(image_path)
print(f"Predicted Writer: {predicted_writer}")
```

## Performance and Improvements

- **Current Accuracy:** \~95% training, \~84% validation
- Applied techniques:
  - Data augmentation
  - Model tuning
  - Regularization
- Further improvements are being explored, including hyperparameter tuning and advanced augmentation methods.

## Future Enhancements

- Experimenting with deeper CNN architectures
- Using transfer learning for feature extraction
- Implementing contrastive loss and Siamese networks for writer verification
- Expanding dataset with additional samples
